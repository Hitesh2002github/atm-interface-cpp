💳 ATM Interface (C++)

A simple and interactive ATM interface developed in C++ using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 
This console-based project demonstrates encapsulation, input validation, and menu-driven programming in an easy-to-understand 
structure — ideal for academic projects and interview demonstrations.

📌 Features:

🔐 PIN-based secure login with limited attempts (max 3)
💰 Deposit money with input validation
💸 Withdraw money with balance checks and error handling
📊 Check account balance
📋 Clean and interactive menu-driven interface
❌ Graceful handling of invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values)
👨‍💻 Written in modern C++ (uses const correctness, clean formatting)

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Language: C++
IDE: Any (Code::Blocks, VS Code, Dev C++, etc.)
Compiler: g++ or any standard C++ compiler

📚 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

✔️ Class & Object usage
✔️ Encapsulation (private members)
✔️ Abstraction (simple interface for user)
✔️ Constructor initialization
✔️ const correctness
✔️ Input validation with cin.fail() and numeric_limits

🗣️ Project Purpose
This project was created as part of a hands-on learning exercise in C++ to demonstrate object-oriented design and basic terminal-based application logic. 
It can be used in coding interviews, academic assignments, or as a base for more advanced banking simulations.
